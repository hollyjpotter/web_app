    <h4 class="header4">Background Information</h4>
    <p class="para">An endangered species is a species that is very likely to become extinct in the near future, either worldwide or in</p>
    <p class="para">a particular political jurisdiction. Endangered species may be at risk due to factors such</p>
    <p class="para">as habitat loss, poaching and invasive species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)</p>
    <p class="para">Red List lists the global conservation status of many species, and various other agencies assess</p>
    <p class="para">the status of species within particular areas. Many nations have laws that protect conservation-reliant</p>
    <p class="para">species which, for example, forbid hunting, restrict land development, or create protected areas.</p>
    <p class="para">Some endangered species are the target of extensive conservation efforts such as captive breeding and</p>
    <p class="para"> habitat restoration. Human activity is a significant cause in causing some species to become endangered.</p>
